# The Shoppies
This application is a simple-to-use, front-end app that can be used to nominate movies for "The Shoppies", a hypothetical movie awards show hosted by Shopify.  Users may search for movies via the OMDB API and add their movies to the list of nominees. Movies cannot be added twice. One may also view the full list of nominees and remove nominees as needed.
